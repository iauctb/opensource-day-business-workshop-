## Successful Bussinesses
### AdaFruit
> Adafruit Industries is an open-source hardware company founded by Limor Fried in 2005. The company designs and manufactures a number of electronics products, sells a wide variety of electronics components, tools, and accessories via its online storefront, and produces a number of learning resources, including written tutorials, introductory videos for children, and the longest running live video electronics show on the internet. All AdaFruit products are manufactured in Manhattan, New York City. In 2013, the company took in $22 million in revenue, and had shipped over a million products in 480,000 orders.

> Adafruit primarily sells “kits” of build-your-own electronic devices, complete with open-source licenses, encouraging customers to modify the final products. But its primary focus is on teaching the world engineering, Fried says — “an educational company that just happens to have a gift shop at the end,” as she puts it.
